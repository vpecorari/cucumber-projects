Hello, 

This is a pretty simple test example on how to use Cucumber with Javascript, only for studies purporses.
This project reveals to the user which is the Burger King Deal of the day.
The daily deals were based on the image "bk_daily_deals.png", attached on this project as well.


-- remember to install nodejs to run this project.



Special thanks to 'Test Automation University' and 'QA Ninja';
